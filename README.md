#  Kunal – Automation Portfolio

This repository is my personal portfolio where I document and showcase the automation workflows I build while learning and experimenting with tools like **n8n, APIs, and messaging platforms**.

Rather than a large collection of client projects, this portfolio represents my practical understanding of automation concepts and real-world problem solving.

My goal is to build workflows that are:
- Simple  
- Reliable  
- Logic-driven  
- Easy to maintain

## 📚 Case Studies

Here are detailed explanations of the automations I have built:

- [AI Receptionist → Appointment Booking + Verification Code System](./case-studies/ai-receptionist-verification-code.md)
- [Lead Nurture + Link tracking + Unsubscribe mechanism automation](case-studies/Lead_Nurture.md)

More projects and case studies will be added as I continue building new workflows.
