# Lead Nurture + Link Tracking System (n8n)

## 🚩 Goal
The goal was to build a logic based system that could automatically:

- Send educational, case-study and CTA emails to a list of cold and warm leads  
- Objection handling 
- Track which users clicked links 
- Follow up based on engagement  
- Handle unsubscribes  
- Maintain all data inside Google Sheets  

Manually doing this would require tracking clicks, sending follow-ups, and updating spreadsheets by hand.

## 🔧 Solution

I built a complete automated outreach and tracking system using n8n that:

1. Pulls leads from Google Sheets  
2. Sends personalized emails  
3. Generates unique tracking links  
4. Detects when a user clicks a link  
5. Updates engagement status  
6. Triggers follow-up emails based on behavior  

Everything runs automatically with no manual work.
